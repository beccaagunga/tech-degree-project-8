Employee Directory using API

Many sites — Twitter, Facebook, IMDB, and Wikipedia to name a few — offer a vast sea of data that you can access and display on your own web pages. Using JavaScript, I've created an employee directory by communicating with a third-party API (Application Programming Interface).

This project was a great introduction to programming. It motivated and excited me to learn start learning a backend language to really see the power in programming.
